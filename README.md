Week_2_new cpp :
A cheese container can hold 2.76 kg of cheese. Each evening, a fromager ships containers of cheese to a local grocery store. The cost of producing one container of cheese is $4.12, and the profit of each container of cheese is $1.45. My program shows the output of the containers required, total cost and profit from them. Proper space was given to show the number in one line.
