Week_2_new cpp :
A cheese container can hold 2.76 kg of cheese. Each evening, a fromager ships containers of cheese to a local grocery store. The cost of producing one container of cheese is $4.12, and the profit of each container of cheese is $1.45. My program shows the output of the containers required, total cost and profit from them. Proper space was given to show the number in one line.

week 3 gh:
It is a shipping calcualtor program. The program asks the user to input the item name, asks if it is fragile(y/n), order total, and where the item will be shipped(usa/can/aus/mars). For different order range and different destination, there is different shipping cost. Also, the program needs to print in a file named "Order.txt"
along with console window. 
order total		ship(USA)		Ship(CAN)		ship(AUS)		ship(mars)
less than 50			6				8				10				15
50 to 100				9				12				14				20
100 to 150			12				15				17				25
over 150				free			free			free			free


vowel_gh:
It is mainly a vowel counter. The program counts the total number of vowel in a file. The file is also used along side vowel_gh.exe on the command line of the console window. Also it prints out an error message if the file is missing. At the same time, I have added three more letters: B,C, and D. As a result, I can know those numbers too. 


surf shop gh:
Johnny Utah owns a surf shop on the beach called ‚ÄúPoint Break Surf Shop‚Äù.  Johnny sells surfboards in 4 three sizes: small (2 meters), medium (3 meters), and large (4 meters) and squirrel surf(50cm). The cost of one small surfboard is $175.00, one medium is $190.00, and one large is $200.00, squirrel size is $100.00
The program should allow the user to do the following:
1. Buy any surfboard in any sizeand in any quanity.
2. At any time show the total number of surfboards of each size sold.
3. At any time show the total money made.

Array_Problem_gh
Write a program to calculate a bowling league's average bowling scores. You will need to read the input data from the file BowlingScores.txt  
You must use three arrays :
1) one - dimensional array to store the bowler's names.
2)(parallel) two - dimensional array to store the bowling scores.
3) one - dimensional array to store the bowler's average score.
Your program must contain at least the following functions :
1)function called GetBowlingData to read and store data into two arrays. The function should take as input parameters the file name and both empty arrays, which it should fill from the file and return a status of either success or failure(i.e. true or false)
2)function called GetAverageScore that is used to calculate the average bowling score. The function should take as input the populated arrays and return the average score of each bowler in a separate array.
3)function called PrettyPrintResults to output the results, i.e., bowler name, scores and average.
