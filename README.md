Week_2_new cpp :
A cheese container can hold 2.76 kg of cheese. Each evening, a fromager ships containers of cheese to a local grocery store. The cost of producing one container of cheese is $4.12, and the profit of each container of cheese is $1.45. My program shows the output of the containers required, total cost and profit from them. Proper space was given to show the number in one line.

week 3 gh:
It is a shipping calcualtor program. The program asks the user to input the item name, asks if it is fragile(y/n), order total, and where the item will be shipped(usa/can/aus/mars). For different order range and different destination, there is different shipping cost. Also, the program needs to print in a file named "Order.txt"
along with console window. 
order total		ship(USA)		Ship(CAN)		ship(AUS)		ship(mars)
less than 50			6				8				10				15
50 to 100				9				12				14				20
100 to 150			12				15				17				25
over 150				free			free			free			free


vowel_gh:
It is mainly a vowel counter. The program counts the total number of vowel in a file. The file is also used along side vowel_gh.exe on the command line of the console window. Also it prints out an error message if the file is missing. At the same time, I have added three more letters: B,C, and D. I as a result, I can know their number too.
